# No Usernames

Removes usernames from the UI and forms and fills the database column with UUIDs.

This extension can be used with or without Flamarkt installed.

The extension is meant to be used with a custom display name driver and custom slug driver.
The default driver for display and slug will still show the underlying username if used.

It has a similar effect as [Passwordless](https://github.com/clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-passwordless) on the login, but also applies to signup and backoffice.
